# enso-radiation-budget

This GitHub repo is used to publicly display code that is a part of a Master's project on the radiative response to El Nino Southern Oscillation ocean temperature patterns. The primary directory of cleaned, up-to-date analysis is the "eof_analysis" directory, and a sample of the calculations used to obtain the data variables in the EOF analysis is provided in "Data".
